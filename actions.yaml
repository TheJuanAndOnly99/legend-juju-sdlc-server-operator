# TEMPLATE-TODO: change this example to suit your needs.
# If you don't need actions, you can remove the file entirely.
# It ties in to the example _on_fortune_action handler in src/charm.py
#
# Learn more about actions at: https://juju.is/docs/sdk/actions

# TODO(aznashwan): determine if the SDLC offers any actions
# Possible ones may include:
#   - creating a Gitlab project (or whatever other "bootstrapping actions"
#     are needed on Gitlab)
#   - creating a legend "workspace" (i.e. tenant)
